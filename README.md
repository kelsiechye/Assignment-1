# Assignment-1
This is a website to promote the band Afterglow. It starts with a simple introduction of the band itself and how it came about with a picture of the band in the background. At the bottom, there is a simple navigation bar with each section labelled home (aka the main page), members, album, discography and music videos. Also at the bottom of the home page is a simple notice with the band's email and social media if the audience is interested to contact them for shows or follow their social media.
The following pages are simpily to showcase each member, a bunch of photos, their discography and past music videos.
# Design process
Starting with the main page I chose to use an eye catching picture of the band with a picture of the band's logo on the top right hand corner. It continues with a short paragraph introducing the band. I use a slightly translucent bar such that the words are clearly visible without completely cutting off the image of the girls in the background. Next the title, "Background" is used followed by a similar white translucent bar that with a short paragraph explaining how the band Afterglow was formed. Ending off that main body section, I place a navigation bar labelling the total 5 pages including the current main page aka home page such that I am able to use the same navigation bar for every page to maintain its unity. Lastly, an aside that offers an email address for potential clients to contact should they interested to book Afterglow for a show. Along with a line that offers links to their Twitter page and Youtube.
Moving on to the members section, a bold title in red to identify the section. Each member has their own unique image colour which is represnted within their own sections and the title of each of their own sections which is their names. A very simple but informative method of introducing each member with their name, a picture of themsleves, their roles and instruments alogn with some additional information such as their likes and dislikes for the fans. And at the end, the same navigation bar as the one that was from the home page.
Next with the album page, a simple bold title like the previou spages and the pictures are lines in a single column so that each picture is able to stand out and wont get missed when people scroll since there aren't many pictures so the website isn't too long.
With discography, each album is encased in it's own border for easy viewing. The albums are arranged in rows of 2 so that the page looks neat and easy to look at. Within each border, the albums include the title, album photo and list of the songs in each album along with its release date.
Finally the music videos page, jsut a very neat and simple way to view the music videos they have witht he usual title and navigation bar that all the other pages have.
