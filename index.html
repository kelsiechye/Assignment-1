        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="intro">Afterglow is a group formed by 5 childhood friends. When Ran moved to another class in middle school, the 5 girls made a band so that they could keep seeing each other. Now in highschool, they still love playing in their band, practicing after school and playing in live shows. Although they are still pretty inexperienced, their powerful performances and strong vocals have led them to gain popularity.</p>
